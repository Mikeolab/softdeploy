## The Pitch (Copy/Paste):

**Email Subject**: Quick automation audit for [BusinessName]

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Quick one — I help local service businesses stop losing leads with automated missed-call + SMS/WhatsApp follow-up + booking systems.

I noticed [BusinessName] could benefit from instant lead replies and automated follow-up sequences.

I'm offering a $49 Automation Audit (30 mins) where you get:
• A 1-page plan showing exactly what to automate
• The exact messages/sequences to use
• ROI estimate for your business

Want me to send a 2-minute video showing how it would work for [BusinessName]?

Best,
Mike

P.S. If you book the audit and want me to build it, the $49 is deducted from setup cost.

## What Happens After They Book Audit:

1. **30-min call** (Calendly booking)
2. **During call**: Map their flow, show 2-3 automations
3. **After call**: Send 1-page PDF plan
4. **Upsell**: "Want me to build this? Setup is $750, audit fee deducted."
5. **If yes**: 50% deposit → build → 50% on completion

## Tools You Need (All Free):

- ✅ Google Sheets (CRM)
- ✅ Gmail (sending)
- ✅ Calendly (booking - you have this)
- ✅ Google Apps Script (automation)
- ✅ PayPal/Paystack (payments)

## First $500 Goal:

**Path 1**: 10 audits × $49 = $490
**Path 2**: 1 audit ($49) + 1 setup ($750) = $799
**Path 3**: 2 audits ($98) + 1 setup ($750) = $848

**Realistic timeline**: 7-14 days if you do 30 outreaches/day.

---

## If You Get Stuck:

1. **No replies?** → Check your email deliverability (warm up Gmail)
2. **No bookings?** → Lower audit price to $29 / ₦10k temporarily
3. **Can't find emails?** → Use Instagram DM or WhatsApp (manual)
4. **Script not working?** → Check Apps Script execution log

## Remember:

- **Consistency > Perfection**: Send 30/day even if messages aren't perfect
- **Follow-up is everything**: Most sales happen on follow-up 2-3
- **First client is hardest**: After that, you have proof + momentum
- **Start low, scale fast**: Get first 3 clients at lower price, then raise

---

**You've got this. One email at a time. One client at a time. Let's get you paid.**
